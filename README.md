# 4DotNet Developer Day 2019

Used as samples for the 4DotNet Developer Day in 2019.
The focus is on creating a sample application using a variety of serverless technologies.

## Credits

This material is based on the awesome [Serverless Pre-Day Workshop](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-workshop) repository from [Azure Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples).

What current repository adds is the C# implementation for the modules in the original repository.
