## ChallengeCreate a Logic App that will be triggered by a purchase event from the custom Event Grid topic you created in Module 3. ```json{  "orderId": "1",  "itemOrdered": "52325",  "email": "hello@contoso.com"}```Upon receiving the event, the Logic App will query Cosmos DB to retrieve the product information from `itemOrdered` property. Then, send an e-mail with different options (`Very satisfied`, `Satisfied`, `Neutral`, `Unsatisfied`, `Very unsatisfied`) so users can response. Finally, record customer's response in Cosmos DB and take appropriate actions.
