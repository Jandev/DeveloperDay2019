## ChallengeHave two API endpoints, both backed by CosmosDB data.  When I call```GET http://{myFunctionEndpoint}/api/products?id=1```It would return:```json{  "id": "1",  "flavor": "Rainbow Road",  "price-per-scoop": 3.99}```However this data should be pulling from CosmosDB and could be updated at any time by updating CosmosDB directly.In addition a new operation should be added to add products:```POST http://{myFunctionEndpoint}/api/addProducts``````json{ "id": "2", "flavor": "Coco Mountain", "price-per-scoop": 2.99}```Which would add a new document to CosmosDB with the corresponding product information.
