## ChallengeCreate an Azure Function that publishes an event to a custom topic with data about the Ice Cream order every time it is triggered.The event posted to the custom topic must be of the form:```json[  {    "id": string,    "eventType": "BFYOC.IceCream.Order",    "subject": string,    "eventTime": string-in-date-time-format,    "data":{        "orderId": string,        "itemOrdered": string,        "email": string    },    "dataVersion": string  }]```The data payload is the order data, and the outer envelope is the event metadata.You may input your order and trigger the Function however you choose, however, we recommend a POST to an HTTP triggered Function as in the first two modules for simplicity:```POST http://{myFunctionEndpoint}/api/iceCreamOrder``````json{  "orderId": "1",  "itemOrdered": "52325",  "email": "hello@contoso.com"}```
