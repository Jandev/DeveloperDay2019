﻿﻿## ChallengeRun and test an Azure Function locally where you can do a `GET` on a specific endpoint and pass in a product ID.  The product ID will return information on the product flavor.  For example if you did the following HTTP Request:```GET http://{myFunctionEndpoint}/api/products?id=1```It would return:```json{  "id": "1",  "flavor": "Rainbow Road",  "price-per-scoop": 3.99}```For this challenge, just have the function return static data.  No need to connect to a database behind the scenes.You or your team must be able to show this function running locally and published to Azure.
